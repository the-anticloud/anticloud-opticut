## What This Project Is

Sparrows are master weavers, crafting nests with intricate patterns. They utilize geometry and symmetry to ensure structural integrity and stability.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

```
pip install -e .
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**General usage:**
```bash
cargo run --release  -- \
    -i [path to input JSON, or a solution JSON] \
    -t [timelimit in seconds (default is 600s)]
```
The optimization process contains two distinct phases: exploration & compression.
By default 80% of the timelimit is spent exploring and 20% is spent compressing.
Pressing 'Ctrl + C' immediately moves the algorithm to the next phase, or terminates it.

**All CLI options:**
```bash
-i, --input <INPUT>              Path to the input JSON file, or a solution JSON file for warm starting
-t, --global-time <GLOBAL_TIME>  Set a global time limit (in seconds)
-e, --exploration <EXPLORATION>  Set the exploration phase time limit (in seconds)
-c, --compression <COMPRESSION>  Set the compression phase time limit (in seconds)
-x, --early-termination          Enable early termination of the optimization process
-s, --rng-seed <RNG_SEED>        Fixed seed for the random number generator
--workers <WORKERS>           Number of worker threads used by the separator
-h, --help                       Print help
```

**Concrete example**:
```bash
cargo run --release -- \
    -i data/input/swim.json
```

## Anticloud Overlay

The 12 improvements live under `anticloud/`. Run the check suite from this directory:

```
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

Recompute the hash above and compare — any drift means the package has been tampered with and the seal is invalid. This is a self-assessment; no external audit has been performed and a SOC 2 / NIST independent audit is committed post-funding.
